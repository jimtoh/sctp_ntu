# Lesson

## Brief

### Preparation and Lesson Overview

We will be using Google Colaboratory (you can use the same google account created in the previous unit) in this lesson. Google Colaboratory (Colab) is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud and can be stored in your Google Drive.

Colab runs in a Linux environment and comes with many popular Python libraries pre-installed. You can also install additional libraries using `pip` commands. It is a great tool for learning and experimenting with data science and machine learning. Read more about it in [Self Studies](./studies.md).

We will be running Spark on Colab. As Spark is a distributed data processing framework written in Scala and runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), it requires a Java runtime environment to run. Colab comes with a Java runtime environment pre-installed, so we can run Spark on Colab without any additional setup.

## Part 2 - Hands-on with Spark

We will be using [this](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FIiiHUn9Oa8GL6CsibTkjbPuUeeSx3DX?usp=sharing) Colab notebook throughout the lesson.

> Open the Colab link, then go to File -> Save a copy in Drive. This will create a copy of the notebook in your Google Drive. It will then open the notebook in a new tab.
